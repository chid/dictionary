Firstly, create a print function
Then, create an insert function, and thus these two functions can be tested ;)

create inorder and preorder print :)
such that the tree structure can be recreated.

try use ANSI CODES for bold to indicate ends of words :)


I have written a function to print all the list words ;)
// not sure about analysing the complexity...
but yeah, it just pretty much does extract(root,"");
