<h2>Dictionary representation</h2>

<p>
You are to represent the dictionary using the optimised tree representation
given in the header <tt>dictionary_type.h</tt>. Include this header into your
<tt>dictionary.c</tt> implementation, but not into any other files.

<h3>Dictionaries as multi-way trees</h3>

<p>
We represent dictionaries as multi-branch trees with labelled edges:
<pre>
struct dictEdge
{
  char     thisChar;     /* character labelling this edge */
  bool     isTerminal;   /* a word may end with character */
  struct dictEdge* child;        /* suffix dictionary */
  struct dictEdge* sibling;      /* next sibling edge */
};
</pre>

<p>
Any path from the root that ends in an edge whose <tt>isTerminal</tt> flag
is set is a valid word in the dictionary. Dictionary nodes are implicitly
represented by a set of edges connected via sibling links.

<p>
Siblings are ordered, but the value of <tt>thisChar</tt> is different
for every edge of a single dictionary node. Sibling lists and tree paths
are terminated by <tt>NULL</tt> links.
