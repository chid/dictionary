<h2>Dictionary interface</h2>

<h3>Interface</h3>

<p>
This page describes the interface of the dictionary ADT that you are
to implement. For your implementation, download
<a href="dictionary.h"><tt>dictionary.h</tt></a> and
implement each function whose prototype is given in the header
file. You cannot freely choose a representation for the dictionary;
instead, you must use the a fixed representation. All your code should go
into a file <tt>dictionary.c</tt>, which you have to submit to complete
the assignment. The following is a description of the components of
the interface.

<h3>Constants</h3>

<p>
We represent Booleans by
<pre>
typedef enum
{
  False,
  True
}
bool;
</pre>

<h3>Word lists</h3>

<p>
We represent lists of words to be entered or extracted from the
dictionary using the following linked list data structure:
<pre>
struct wlnode
{
  char* word;
  struct wlnode* next;
};
</pre>

<p>
An empty linked list is represented by a <tt>NULL</tt> pointer (there is no
dummy node for an empty list). The last element in the linked list has
its next pointer set to <tt>NULL</tt>.

<h3>Initialisation</h3>

<p>
Before any other dictionary functions may be invoked, the dictionary
must be initialised:
<pre>
struct dictionary*
dictInit ();
</pre>

<h3>Inserting</h3>

<p>
The following two functions insert into the dictionary one and
multiple words, respectively:
<pre>
void
dictInsertWord  (struct dictionary* dict, char* word);
void
dictInsertWords (struct dictionary* dict, struct wlnode* words);
</pre>

<h3>Searching</h3>

<p>
This function checks whether a given word is in the dictionary:
<pre>
bool
dictLookup (struct dictionary* dict, char* word);
</pre>

<h3>Extracting</h3>

<p>
This function extracts all the words from a dictionary that start with
a given prefix:
<pre>
struct wlnode*
dictCompletions (struct dictionary* dict, char* word);
</pre>

<p>
The prefix may be the empty string, in which case <tt>dictCompletions</tt>
should return a list of all the words in the dictionary. Of course, if
no words match then an empty list should be returned (just a NULL
pointer). The memory allocated for the list nodes and strings in the
returned list should be freed by the caller. The order of the elements
in this list does not matter.

<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: 2 marks of the assignment are for the efficiency of this
function. To get these marks, your code must meet three conditions:

<ul>
<li>
The complexity of your code must be linear in the number of characters
contained in the returned word list.
<li>
You must produce the result in one sweep through the dictionary tree;
i.e., you may only visit each node/edge ones.
<li>
The space allocated for the words in the resulting word list must be
<em>reasonable</em>; make the allocation dependent on the actual length
of the individual words.
</ul>

<p>
If your code does <b>not</b> meet these requirements, but is producing the
correct result, you will still get some marks during automarking, but
none or not all of the 2&nbsp;marks dedicated to the performance of
<tt>dictCompletions()</tt>.

<h3>Deleting</h3>

<p>
This function erases all dictionary entries and releases all the
memory allocated for the dictionary.
<pre>
void
dictFree (struct dictionary*);
</pre>

<h3>Returning Root of Trie</h3>

<p>
The last function returns the root of the dictionary. We will use this
function to walk through your trie, so to check if you have correctly
implemented the trie structure. We define the root to be the first
node at the first level of the trie. If you have set your root as an
empty string node, then please return its child node for this
function.
<pre>
struct dictEdge*
dictGetRoot (struct dictionary* dict);
</pre>

<p>
Specifically, if the trie is empty, you should return <tt>NULL</tt>. If the
trie is not empty, you should return the first node in the top level
of your trie.

<p>
If you have named the root variable of your trie to be <tt>root</tt>,
then your <tt>dictGetRoot</tt> would look as simple as the code below,
assuming <tt>root</tt> is initialised as <tt>NULL</tt>:
<pre>
struct dictEdge*
dictGetRoot (struct dictionary* dict)
{ 
  return dict->root ; 
}
</pre>
