<h2>Automated Testing</h2>

9&nbsp;marks of the assignment will awarded by an automated marker. In order to help students avoid problems with the automarker (e.g. scoring&nbsp;0 for a silly mistake), the automarker will run at least every 6&nbsp;hours during the last week until the assignment is due. Code submitted with <tt>give</tt> will be automarked within the following 6&nbsp;hours and the results will be emailed back to you.

<p>
We reserve the right to refine the automarker over time, but if your code passes the automarker at present, then you can be reasonably sure you haven't made too many silly mistakes.

<p>
The automarker performs several types of tests. Each of these are worth some portion of the automarker's results. Examples are:

<ul>
<li>compare raw output from <tt>dictCompletions()</tt> and/or
<tt>dictLookup()</tt>
<li>examine your trie data structure in detail to ensure all required nodes
exist and no unnecessary nodes exist.
<li>test with <tt>valgrind</tt> to check for memory leaks
(See <a href=https://wiki.cse.unsw.edu.au/cs1927cgi/10s1/DebuggingTools>Debugging Tools</a>)
<li>test with <tt>mudflap</tt> to find memory usage errors
(See <a href=https://wiki.cse.unsw.edu.au/cs1927cgi/10s1/DebuggingTools>Debugging Tools</a>)
</ul>
